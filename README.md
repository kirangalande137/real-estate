# real-estate
I created a real estate website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. The website features data mapping, routing, and form management with Formik. It allows users to browse property listings, search for specific criteria, and contact property owners or agents.

The frontend is built with React.js, utilizing frameworks such as Material-UI and React Bootstrap to create a responsive and modern user interface. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express.js, handles data processing and API requests, ensuring efficient communication with the MySQL database.

Key functionalities include:

- **Data Mapping:** Dynamic display of property listings and detailed views of individual properties.
- **Routing:** Seamless navigation between pages using React Router, enhancing user experience.
- **Form Management:** Integration of Formik for handling user inputs, such as search filters and contact forms, with validation and submission handling.

The project emphasizes modular design, clean code, and scalability, providing a robust platform for users to explore real estate options effectively.
